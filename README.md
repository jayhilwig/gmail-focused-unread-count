**Gmail Focused Unread Count** helps you stay focused on your unread Gmail emails by updating the Gmail favicon with the number of unread messages in your inbox. Instead of constantly checking your inbox or getting distracted by notifications, this extension provides a simple, unobtrusive way to monitor your unread email count directly from your browser tab. With clear visibility of the unread count, you can quickly stay on top of important messages without needing to open Gmail.
